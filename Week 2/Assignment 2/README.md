# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a personal portfolio using flexbox and grid, while also using a separate css file.

# Flexbox and Grid Implementation

Flexbox was utilized for the navigation in the header and the project cards and contact me sections. 

I used flexbox in the header to have the contents in a line, give them padding, spacing, add a background color, put the navigation in a list, and bold the navigation links and underline them when hovered over. 

I used flexbox in the project cards to give them a background color, padding, spacing, and put them in a line. It's a similar story with the contact me section, but without the background color.

I used grid for the overall layout of the page. I used grid for the image borders, content layout, and the copyright footer.
