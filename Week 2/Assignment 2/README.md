# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a personal portfolio using flexbox and grid, while also using a separate css file.

# Flexbox and Grid Implementation

Flexbox was utilized for the navigation in the header and the project cards section. 

 I used flexbox in the header to have the contents in a line, give them padding, add a background color, put the navigation in a list, and bold the navigation links and underline them when hovered over.

 I used flexbox in the project cards to give them a background color, padding, center the cards, and 

I used grid for the overall layout of the page.
