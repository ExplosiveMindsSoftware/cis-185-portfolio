Class: CIS 185  
Assignment: HTML Elements Challenge  
Date: 2 October 2025  

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to choose five HTML elements not covered in the class lecture and implement them in an extended HTML file.

# HTML Elements Used

1: ```<blockquote>```

**Purpose:**
Formats an extended quotation.

**Use in my code:**
I quoted a line in Japanese by Monkey D Luffy from the anime *One Piece*.

**Usefulness:**
This can be used for citing long quotes from a book, movie, video game, song, or another website.

2: ```<code>```

**Purpose:**
Formats text as code

**Use in my code**
I formatted the "Hello, World" Python program as code.

**Usefulness**
This can be used to showcase code snippets or examples.

3: ```<ruby>, <rp>, and <rt>```

**Purpose:**
Ruby adds small annotations at the top or bottom of text, rp provides fall-back parentheses for browsers without ruby support, and rt specifies which text to add annotations to, usually non-roman alphabet languages such as Chinese or Japanese.

**Use in my code:**
I added romaji furigana to the Japanese *One Piece* quote so that it can be easily sounded out by English speakers.

**Usefulness:**
This can be used to help language learners, especially of Asian languages, sound out or read non-roman alphabet text.

4: ```<button>```   

**Purpose:**
Displays a button that performs an action.

**Use in my code**
I put a button that thanks you for clicking it when clicked.

**Usefulness**
This can be used to launch a log-in page, redirect to another page, and more.

5: ```<address>```

**Purpose**
Displays a clickable link to contact information such as email or phone number.

**Use in my code**
I provided my student email that when clicked will launch the default email client.

**Usefulness**
This can be used to provide contact information and allows for quick initiation of communication.

# CSS Styling Applied

I applied the following CSS styles to the previously mentioned elements:

* ```<blockquote>```: Italicized and set left margin to 40 px
* ```<code>```: Set background to black, text to light green, added 2 px by 4 px padding, and font to Courier
* ```<ruby>, <rp>, and <rt>```: Set font size to medium
