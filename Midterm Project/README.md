# CIS-185 - Midterm Project
Project Name: Comics Global  
Author: Jorge Cordero  
Date: 14 November 2025  

# Project Description

This is a comic book shop website for the fictional "Comics Global" comic store. It shows featured comics from six different countries, an about page, and a contact page.

# Target Audience

Comic book enthusiasts of all ages who want the latest and classic comics and a place to hang out.

# Main Features

Feature 1: Responsive design for mobile

Feature 2: Hover animation for featured comics cards

Feature 3: Form validation for email us form

# Technologies Used

I used HTML5 for semantics, CSS3 and Bootstrap for styling and hover animation, and JavaScript for form validation and send confirmation.

# File Structure

index.html is the homepage, contact.html is the contact page, and about.html is the about page. The js folder holds the JavaScript files, the CSS folder holds the custom CSS, and the images folder holds the images used on the website. README.md is this document explaning the work.

# Challenges Faced



# AI Tools Used

I used Google Gemini to help with custom CSS.

# Future Improvements
