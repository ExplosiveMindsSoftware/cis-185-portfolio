# CIS-185 - Midterm Project
Project Name: Comics Global  
Author: Jorge Cordero  
Date: 14 November 2025  

# Project Description

This is a comic book shop website for the fictional "Comics Global" comic store. It shows featured comics from six different countries, an about page, and a contact page.

# Target Audience

Comic book enthusiasts of all ages who want comics both old and new and from around the world, as well as a place to hang out.

# Main Features

Feature 1: Responsive design for mobile

Feature 2: Info cards with six different comics

Feature 3: Hover animation for featured comics cards

Feature 4: Form validation for email us form

Feature 5: Clickable link for phone number

# Technologies Used

I used HTML5 for semantic structure, CSS3 and Bootstrap for styling and comic card hover animation, and JavaScript for form validation and message send confirmation.

# File Structure

index.html is the homepage, contact.html is the contact page, and about.html is the about page. The js folder holds the JavaScript files, the CSS folder holds the custom CSS, and the images folder holds the images used on the website. README.md is this document explaning the work.

# Challenges Faced

At first, I had a hard time choosing the style for the website. I used Gemini to generate custom CSS to go with my Bootstrap code. I also used Gemini to help me with the JavaScript script for form validation, as I was having a hard time approaching that.

# AI Tools Used

I used Google Gemini to help with custom CSS and the form validation with JavaScript.

# Future Improvements

If I had more time, I would have added a search function to search for comics using the Comic Vine API and HTTP requests and responses, along with creating a page for store inventory. I also would have styled the entire website to look like a comic book with comic panels.
