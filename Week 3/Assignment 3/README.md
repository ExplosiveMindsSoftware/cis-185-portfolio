## Responsive Portfolio
Name: Jorge Cordero  
Class: CIS 185  
Assignment: Responsive Portfolio

## Project Overview

This project displays and compares two versions of my portfolio website with responsive design:

#### Version 1
Manual responsiveness using flexbox, media queries, and custom CSS.

#### Version 2
Responsiveness using the Bootstrap 5 framework.

## Complexity Comparison

### Custom CSS:

The HTML code was light compared to the weight of the CSS code. Index.html has 78 lines of code, while styles.css has 185 lines of code.

### Bootstrap: 

It is the opposite of custom CSS. Styles.css only has two lines of code, while index.html has 108 lines of code.

## Development Time

### Custom CSS

This took a while, as I basically created a design from the ground up. What mostly added to the development time were the media queries.

### Bootstrap

Using Bootstrap was fairly easy, as I only had to add classes to the tags. The biggest downside is that I had to use a lot of div tags.

## Pros and Cons

### CSS Pros:
* More direct control over design
* By using styles.css, the HTML code will be less bloated

### CSS Cons: 
* Takes longer to develop compared to Bootstrap
* Needs additional work to be responsive

### Bootstrap Pros: 
* Fast development time
* Has responsiveness built in

### Boostrap Cons: 
* Designs can be generic without supplementary custom CSS
* Adds a lot of lines to HTML code

## Preference

I feel like using a combination of both is optimal. However, I prefer mainly using Bootstrap due to its rapid development time and ease of responsiveness implementation.
